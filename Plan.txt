Step 1 create the board.
    ChessBoard
        Need to make an array that creates the board. 8 rows with 8 columns. private that goes outside any methods.
Step 2 clearing the board
    ChessBoard
        Need to call the resetboard method inside the chessboard. Then inside the reset method we need to make a loop that goes through
        our board array and sets everything to null
Step 3
    ChessPosition
        Need to make sure that we now where the piece is for row and col. establish them in chess position and return them in the
        get row and get column methods.
Step 4
    ChessBoard
    ChessPiece
        In resetBoard, after clearing the board, use addPiece to add all black major pieces to row 8 and black pawns to row 7.
        Use addPiece to place all white major pieces on row 1 and white pawns on row 2.
        In ChessPiece, make sure the constructor saves type and color, and the getters return those values (similar to Step 3).
Step 5
    ChessBoard
        Implement the getPiece method. Use ChessPosition to get the right row and column, (similar to addpiece method)
        return the ChessPiece at that position (or null if empty).
Step 6
    ChessMove
        add private fields to chessmove based upon the method chessmove
        write the constructors this.blank = blank
        write the getters return blank
Step 7
    ChessPiece
        Begin logic for Rook and Bishop move cases.
        move logic for all four straight directions (up, down, left, right).
        move logic for all four diagonal directions (up-right, up-left, down-right, down-left), using for-loops.
